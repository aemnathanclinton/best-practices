Getting Started with Software Development
=========================================


Join the USGS Organization on GitHub
------------------------------------

If you do not yet have an account, you can [create a free account][1].

[Associate your official USGS email address with your GitHub account][2]. This
can be done using the newly-created account (above) if you did not previously
have one, or it can be your old account if you have been on GitHub previously.
**Be sure your official email address is public**. Also, when taking any
web-based actions on GitHub, make sure your primary email address is set to
your official USGS email address.

Once you have a GitHub account send an email to [gs_github_admin@usgs.gov][3]
and request to join the organization. Include in this email your GitHub account
name (especially important when this does not match your USGS username). An
organization administrator (USGS employee) will invite you to the organization
and you will have to accept the invitation. Once you have accepted the
invitation, [publicize your membership][4].


Start Developing
----------------

Your GitHub account is your own. You can [create public repositories][5] within
your user account namespace without formal approval. There is no limitation on
what can be done in these "[scratch software][13]" repositories, however keep
in mind that commits made to these repositories are public to the world. A best
practice is to **never commit private or otherwise sensitive** information.

While actively developing a project, it is recommended you follow an
"[Integration Manager Workflow][5]". This workflow works especially well
when collaboratively developing a project, however, it works when
working as a solo developer on a project as well. This workflow encourages
[pull requests][6] be used for integration. Pull requests facilitate peer review
as you actively develop software.

All software developed by the USGS should by default use an open-source license
(put a "LICENSE.md in the project root") and should also include
[appropriate preliminary (provisional) software disclaimers][7].

See the [example project scaffold][8] for what a new project might look like.


Next Steps
----------

Learn more about different [software types][9] and [software stages][10]
along with the corresponding [review types][11] and [metadata inventory][14]
required for each in order to [release the software][12] to various degrees.
